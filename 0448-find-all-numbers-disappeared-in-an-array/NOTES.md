### Approach:
Iterate over nums, for each value we find mark it as found by multiplying the value in its index by -1.\
Another approach is to use a frequency array to count the occurrence of each number but will be O(n) space complexity.
​
### Complexity:
**Time Complexity: `O(n)`**\
**Space Complexity: `O(1)`** *=> ignoring output space*
