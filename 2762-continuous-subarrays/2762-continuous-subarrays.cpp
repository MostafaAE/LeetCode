/**
 * Approach:
 * 1. Use a sliding window approach to count all valid subarrays where the difference between 
 *    the maximum and minimum elements in the current window is â‰¤ 2.
 * 2. Maintain two heaps:
 *    - `maxHeap` to track the maximum value in the current window.
 *    - `minHeap` to track the minimum value in the current window.
 * 3. Expand the window by incrementing `right`, pushing the index into both heaps.
 * 4. If the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the window exceeds 2:
 *    - Shrink the window by incrementing `left`.
 *    - Remove indices from the heaps that fall outside the window.
 * 5. For every valid window, add `(right - left + 1)` to the result, which is the number of subarrays ending at `right`.
 * 6. Continue until `right` traverses the entire array.
 * 
 * Complexity:
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 * - Each index is pushed into and popped from the heaps at most once, and heap operations are O(log n).
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
 * - Space for the `maxHeap` and `minHeap`.
