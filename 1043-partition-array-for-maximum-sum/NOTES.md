### Approach:
Dynamic Programming Memoization.<br>
​
Direct Consecutive range pattern<br>
​
We want to find a good array split<br>
​
dp(idx)<br>
Try all consecutive ranges as long as subarrays length < k
​
### Complexity:
**Time Complexity: `O(N^2)`**\
**Space Complexity: `O(N)`** *where N is the max index*
