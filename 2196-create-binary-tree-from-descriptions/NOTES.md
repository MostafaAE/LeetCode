### Approach:
- Use an unordered_map to create and store TreeNode pointers for each unique value in descriptions.
- Use an unordered_set to keep track of all child nodes.
- Iterate through the descriptions:
- If a node value does not exist in the map, create a new TreeNode and add it to the map.
- Mark the child nodes in the unordered_set.
- Link the parent node to the child node based on the relationship type (left or right).
- Find the root node by checking which node is not in the child set.
