### Approach:
- First, create a list of arrival times associated with the original index of each friend.
- Sort the list by the arrival time to simulate each friend's arrival in chronological order.
- Use two min-heaps:
- One to track available chairs in ascending order.
- Another to track the chairs that will become available, based on the friends' leaving times.
- For each friend's arrival:
- Remove any chairs from the "busy" heap if the leave time has passed, pushing them into the "available" heap.
- Assign the friend the smallest available chair, or the next available chair if no chairs are free.
- Track the target friend's chair and return it as soon as they arrive.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n logn)`**, where `n` is the number of friends. Sorting the arrival list takes O(n log n), and each operation with the heaps is O(log n).
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**, due to the heaps and the storage for arrival times.
