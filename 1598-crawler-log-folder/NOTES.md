### Approach:
- Initialize `count` to 0 to represent the current depth in the directory structure.
- Iterate through each log entry:
- If the log entry is "../", decrement `count` by 1, ensuring it doesn't go below 0.
- If the log entry is not "./", increment `count` by 1.
- Ignore the log entry "./" as it represents staying in the same directory.
- The value of `count` at the end will be the minimum number of operations to return to the main folder.
