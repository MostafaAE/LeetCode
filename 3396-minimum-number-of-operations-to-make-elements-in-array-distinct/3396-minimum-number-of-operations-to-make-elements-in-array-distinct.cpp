    * Approach:
    * - Iterate the array from the end, maintaining a set of seen numbers.
    * - For each number, try to insert it into the set.
    *   - If insertion fails (i.e., the number was already seen), it means weâ€™ve encountered a duplicate.
    *   - At that point, return the group number as `(i / 3 + 1)` where `i` is the index of the duplicate.
    * - If no duplicates are found, return 0.
    * 
    * Time Complexity: O(N)
    * - We iterate through the array once and each insertion/check in the unordered_set is O(1) on average.
    * 
    * Space Complexity: O(N)
    * - In the worst case, all elements are unique, and we store them in the set.
