### Approach:
- Sort the positions of the balls.
- Use binary search to find the largest minimum distance between the balls.
- The search range for the distance is between 1 and the maximum possible distance (difference between the smallest and largest position divided by m-1).
- For each midpoint distance, check if it's possible to place all m balls such that the minimum distance between any two balls is at least the midpoint distance.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n log(n*d))`**, Sorting the positions takes O(n log n), Binary search runs in O(log d) iterations, where d is the difference between the smallest and largest position divided by m-1, The isPossibleDistance check runs in O(n) for each iteration of binary search.
- **Space Complexity: `O(logn)`**, for sorting.
