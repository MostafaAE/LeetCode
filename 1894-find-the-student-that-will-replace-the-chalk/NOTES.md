### Approach:
- First, calculate the total sum of chalk.
- Compute the remaining chalk after full rounds by taking `k % sum`.
- Iterate through the `chalk` vector and subtract the chalk requirements from the remaining chalk.
- When the remaining chalk is less than the current student's requirement, return the index of that student.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**, where `n` is the size of the `chalk` vector.
- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**
