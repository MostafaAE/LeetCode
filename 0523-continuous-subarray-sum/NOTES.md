### Approach:
- Use a prefix sum and a hash map to store the remainder when the prefix sum is divided by k.
- If the same remainder is found again, it means there is a subarray whose sum is a multiple of k.
- When we find a subarray whose sum is a multiple of k, and its length is at least 2, then return true.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**, where n is the number of elements in the nums array.
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**
