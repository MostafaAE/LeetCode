### Approach:
- Priority Queue approach (The smallest fractions will be formed by dividing each element by the largest element in the array).
- Initialize a priority queue that stores pairs in the form {-fraction, {numerator_index, denominator_index}}.
- Start by pushing all possible fractions formed by dividing each element by the last element of the array into the priority queue.
- Iteratively remove the top element from the priority queue and replace it with a new fraction formed by dividing the same numerator by the next smaller denominator.
- Essentially, we replace the smallest fraction with the next smallest fraction having the same numerator. Repeating this k - 1 times leaves the kth smallest fraction at the top of the priority queue.

- **Time Complexity: `O((n+k) logn)`**
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**
