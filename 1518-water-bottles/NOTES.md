### Approach:
- Start with the initial number of full water bottles.
- While there are enough empty bottles to exchange for a new full bottle:
- Calculate how many new full bottles can be obtained from the empty bottles.
- Update the number of empty bottles to reflect the new full bottles and the remainder.
- Add the number of new full bottles to the total count of water bottles consumed.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(logM(N))`**, where M is `numExchange`, N is `numBottles`.
- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**
