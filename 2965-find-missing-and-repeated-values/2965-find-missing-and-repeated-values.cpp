    /**
     * Approach:
     * - The grid contains numbers from 1 to n^2, but one number is missing, and another is repeated.
     * - We use Cycle Sort to place each number in its correct position:
     *   - The correct position for a number `val` is determined by:
     *     - `x = (val - 1) / n` (row index)
     *     - `y = (val - 1) % n` (column index)
     *   - If a number is already at its correct position, we move on.
     *   - If swapping is required, we swap `grid[i][j]` with `grid[x][y]`.
     *   - If we find a duplicate (i.e., two values at the same position are the same), we record it as `repeated`.
     * - After sorting, we scan the grid to find the missing number.
     * 
     * Complexity Analysis:
     * - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
     *   - We iterate over the entire grid and perform cycle sort, which runs in O(n^2) time for an n√ón grid.
     * - Space Complexity: O(1)
     *   - Sorting is done in-place, using only a few extra variables.
