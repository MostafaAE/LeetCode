### Approach:
- Calculate the initial sum of the nums array.
- For each element in nums, calculate the potential change (delta) in its value if it were XORed with k.
- delta[i] = (nums[i] ^ k) - nums[i]
- This delta represents how much the element would increase or decrease if we apply the XOR operation.
- Sort the delta array in descending order to prioritize the most beneficial changes first.
- Iterate over the delta array in pairs. If the sum of a pair of deltas is positive, update the total sum accordingly.
- Return the updated total sum after considering the beneficial changes.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n logn)`**, where n is the number of elements in nums.
- **Space Complexity: `O(h)`**
