### Approach:
This is actually a hard Ad-hoc problem xD\
Get the length of the longest decreasing suffix subarray, then swap the next number to it with its successor from longest decreasing suffix subarray, then sort the longest decreasing suffix subarray (reverse).

### Complexity:
**Time Complexity: O(n)**\
**Space Complexity: O(1)**
