### Approach:
- Use a stack to simulate the process of removing pairs of characters "AB" and "CD".
- Traverse through each character in the string `s`:
- If the current character forms a pair with the top of the stack (either "AB" or "CD"), pop the stack.
- Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
- After processing the entire string, the remaining length of the string (after removing valid pairs) is returned.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**, where `n` is the length of the string. We process each character once.
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**, for the stack, in the worst case when no pairs are removed.
