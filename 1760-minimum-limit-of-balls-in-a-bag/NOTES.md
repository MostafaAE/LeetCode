### Approach:
1. Use binary search to find the minimum possible value of the maximum ball size (`num`) that can satisfy the operations limit.
2. Define `start` as `1` (minimum possible size) and `end` as the maximum element in `nums`.
3. Perform binary search:
- Calculate the mid-point value (`mid`) and check if it's possible to divide all numbers in `nums` into sizes no greater than `mid` using at most `maxOperations`.
- If possible, update `result` to `mid` and search in the lower half (`end = mid - 1`).
- Otherwise, search in the upper half (`start = mid + 1`).
4. The helper function `checkNumOfOperations` calculates the number of operations required to split the elements into sizes no greater than `num`:
- For each element in `nums`, the number of splits needed is `ceil(nums[i] / num) - 1`.
- If the total operations exceed `maxOperations`, return `false`; otherwise, return `true`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n * logk)`**, where `k` is the largest number in `nums`
- **Space Complexity: `O(h)`**
