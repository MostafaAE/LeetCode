### Approach:
Two pointers approach, when we encounter two different characters attempt the following:
1. Delete the character at the 'left' pointer and continue checking for palindrome
2. Delete the character at the 'right' pointer and continue checking for palindrome

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(L)`**
- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**
