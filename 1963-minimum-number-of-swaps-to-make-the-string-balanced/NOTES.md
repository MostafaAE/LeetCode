### Approach:
- Use a stack to track unmatched brackets as we traverse the string.
- For each character in the string:
- If the character is ']' and the top of the stack is '[', we pop the stack, representing a valid pair.
- Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
- After processing, the remaining characters in the stack will consist of unmatched brackets.
- The number of swaps needed to balance the string is derived from half the unmatched brackets divided by 2, since each swap fixes two mismatches.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**, where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**, in the worst case where all characters are pushed onto the stack.
