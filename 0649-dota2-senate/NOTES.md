### Approach:
- Iterate through the senate string and enqueue each senator into a queue and count the total number of Radiants and Dires senators.
- Then, simulate the voting process by iterating through the queue until either all Radiants or all Dires are eliminated.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(nlogn)`**
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**
