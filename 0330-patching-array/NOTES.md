### Approach:
- Use a greedy algorithm to ensure every number up to n can be formed by the sum of the given numbers in nums and the numbers we might add.
- Track the smallest number that cannot be formed with the current set of numbers using 'miss'.
- Iterate through nums and add elements to 'miss' until 'miss' exceeds 'n'.
- If the current element in nums is larger than 'miss' or all elements in nums are used, double 'miss' and count it as an added number.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(m + logn)`**, where m is the size of nums, and n is the target value.
- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**
