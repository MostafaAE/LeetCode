### Approach:
Use a count variable that is incremented by 1 every 1 encountered and decremented by 1 every 0 encountered\
Start traversing the array If at any moment count becomes 0, it implies that we've encountered equal number of zeros and ones from the beginning till the current or if we encountered the same count twice, it means that the number of zeros and ones are equal between the indices corresponding to the equal count values
