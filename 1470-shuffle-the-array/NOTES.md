### Approach:
- Use bitwise operations to interleave the elements of the two halves of the array in place.
- First, encode both x_i and y_i into nums[i] for i in the range [0, n) using bitwise operations.
- Then, decode the elements and place them in the correct order for the shuffled array.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**, where n is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**
