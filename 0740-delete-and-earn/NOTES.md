### Approach:
Dynamic Programming Memoization (Pick or leave approach).\
We can improve the memory complexity further by converting it to tabulation approach, by doing so we will need only the previous two history values instead of a whole array.

### Complexity:
**Time Complexity: `O(nlogn)`**\
**Space Complexity: `O(n)`**
