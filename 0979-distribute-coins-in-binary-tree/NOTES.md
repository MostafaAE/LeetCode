### Approach:
- Use Postorder traversal (DFS) to traverse the tree.
- At each node, calculate the excess coins (positive value) or the lack of coins (negative value).
- Sum the absolute values of the excess or deficit of coins at each node to determine the total number of moves.
- The excess coins at a node are calculated as the sum of the excess coins from its left and right children, plus the coins at the current node, minus 1 (since each node should have exactly one coin).

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**
- **Space Complexity: `O(h)`** *=> auxiliary space for stack `h` could be `(n)` or `(logn)` depending on the shape of the tree*
