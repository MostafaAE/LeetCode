### Approach:
We use a sliding window technique to find the longest subarray where each number appears at most k times.
- As we move the window to the right, we track how many times each number appears.
- If any number appears more than k times, we shrink the window from the left until it meets the frequency requirement.
- We update the longest subarray length encountered during this process.
