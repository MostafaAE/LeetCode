### Approach:
1. Traverse the entire matrix to calculate:
- The total sum of the absolute values of all elements (`result`).
- The count of negative numbers (`negCount`).
- The smallest absolute value (`absMin`).
2. If the count of negative numbers (`negCount`) is odd, adjust the result by subtracting twice the smallest absolute value.
- This comes from the observation that we can have only 1 negative number in the matrix after doing the operation "any" number of times.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`**
- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**
