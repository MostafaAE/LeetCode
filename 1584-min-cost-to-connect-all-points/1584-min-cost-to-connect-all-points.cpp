/**
 * Approach:
 * - We use Primâ€™s algorithm to construct the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
 * - The graph is implicit: edges are calculated on the fly based on Manhattan distance.
 * - At each step, we pick the minimum-cost edge that connects a new point to the MST.
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * - O(E * log v), where v is the number of points.
 *   - For each node added, we may process up to n edges.
 * 
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(v) for visited, dist, and priority queue.
