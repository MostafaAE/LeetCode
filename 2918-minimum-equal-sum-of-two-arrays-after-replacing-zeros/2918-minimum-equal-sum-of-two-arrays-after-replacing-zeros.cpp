/**
 * Approach:
 * - We want both arrays to have the same sum after replacing all zeros with positive integers (â‰¥1).
 * - The best we can do is to replace each zero with 1 to minimize the total increase.
 * - So, we compute:
 *   - The current sum of both arrays.
 *   - The number of zeros in both arrays.
 * - Then, the minimum possible total for each array is: current sum + count of zeros.
 * - If an array has no zeros, its sum is fixed. So, if its fixed sum is less than the other array's minimum achievable total,
 *   it's impossible to equalize the sums, hence return -1.
 * - Otherwise, return the maximum of both (they must equal after adding minimal values to zeros).

 * Time Complexity: O(N + M), where N and M are the lengths of nums1 and nums2.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), only constant space used.
