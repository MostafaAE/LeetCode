### Approach:
Dynamic Programming with Memoization (Top-Down).
- Construct a graph to represent transitions between ring indices based on character matches.
- Use dynamic programming to find the minimum number of steps required to spell out the key from the ring.
- Start from the first character of the key and search for possible ways to move the pointer on the ring to match the character.
- For each possible move, calculate the cost of the move and recursively call the function for the next character in the key.
- Memoize the results to avoid redundant calculations.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(K * R^2)`**
- **Space Complexity: `O(KR + R^2)`** *where K is the length of the key and R is the length of the ring.*
