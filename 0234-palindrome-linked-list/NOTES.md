### Approach:
1. Find the middle: use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
2. Reverse the second half: Once you find the middle, reverse the second half of the linked list.
3. Compare the halves: compare each element of the first half with its corresponding element in the reversed second half. If at any point we find a mismatch, the list is not a palindrome.
