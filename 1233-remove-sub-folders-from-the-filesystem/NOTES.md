### Approach:
- Sort the folder paths lexicographically.
- Initialize a vector to store the result with the first folder, as it's the smallest lexicographically.
- For each subsequent folder, check if it is a subfolder of the current root folder by searching for its path as a prefix.
- If it's not a subfolder, add it to the result and update the current root folder.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(N * L * logN)`**, where `N` is the number of folders and `L` is the maximum length of a folder.
- **Space Complexity: `O(N * L)`**, for storing the sorted folders and the result.
