     * Approach:
     * - **Topological Sorting (Kahnâ€™s Algorithm)** is used to detect cycles in the course dependency graph.
     * - Construct a **directed graph** from `prerequisites`, where each edge `u -> v` means `u` must be completed before `v`.
     * - Maintain an **in-degree array** to track the number of prerequisites for each course.
     * - Push all courses with **zero in-degree** into a queue and process them.
     * - If we can process all courses, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.
     * 
     * Complexity Analysis:
     * - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where `V` is `numCourses` and `E` is the number of `prerequisites`.  
     *   - Building the adjacency list takes **O(E)**.
     *   - Traversing all nodes and edges takes **O(V + E)**.
     * - **Space Complexity**: O(V + E)  
     *   - The adjacency list takes **O(E)**.
     *   - The in-degree array takes **O(V)**.
     *   - The queue in the worst case holds **O(V)** elements.
