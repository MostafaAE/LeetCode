     * Approach:
     * - We start with the largest power of 3 within a reasonable range (`3^16`).
     * - Iterate while `n > 0`:
     *   - Check if `n` contains any coefficient greater than `1` when divided by the current power of 3.
     *   - If it does (`n / powerOfThree > 1`), return false (as it means we need more than one of a power).
     *   - Otherwise, subtract the contribution of this power from `n` (`n %= powerOfThree`).
     *   - Move to the next lower power (`powerOfThree /= 3`).
     * - If `n` is reduced to `0`, it means we successfully represented it using distinct powers of 3.
     * 
     * Complexity Analysis:
     * - Time Complexity: O(logâ‚ƒ(n)) 
     * - Space Complexity: O(1)
