     * Approach:
     * - This problem is a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** scheduling problem.
     * - We use **Topological Sorting (Kahnâ€™s Algorithm)** with a queue to process courses in order.
     * - Each node represents a course, and directed edges define prerequisites.
     * - We track **completion times** and propagate them through the graph.
     * - The **maximum completion time** across all courses is the answer.
     *
     * Complexity Analysis:
     * - **Overall Time Complexity**: **O(N + E)**
     *      - **Building the graph** takes **O(N + E)** (where `E` is the number of edges).
     *      - **Topological Sorting** takes **O(N + E)**.
     * - **Space Complexity**: **O(N + E)** (for adjacency list, indegree array, and completion time tracking).
