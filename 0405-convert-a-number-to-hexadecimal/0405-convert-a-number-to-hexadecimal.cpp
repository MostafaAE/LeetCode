/*
 * Approach:
 * - Convert the input to `unsigned int` so that negative numbers are correctly treated as 2's complement 32-bit values.
 * - Use modulus operation to extract each hex digit (val % 16) from the least significant digit.
 * - Append corresponding character: '0' to '9' for 0â€“9, 'a' to 'f' for 10â€“15.
 * - Continue dividing by 16 until value becomes 0.
 * - Reverse the result string since we construct it from LSB to MSB.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(1)
 * - Since the number is a 32-bit integer, the loop runs at most 8 times (32 bits / 4 bits per hex digit).
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
