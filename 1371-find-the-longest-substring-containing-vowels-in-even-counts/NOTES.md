### Approach:
- Use a bitmask to track the parity (even or odd count) of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
- Traverse the string, and whenever a vowel is found, toggle the corresponding bit in the bitmask.
- If the same bitmask has appeared before, it means the substring between the two indices has an even count of all vowels, so update the result.
- Use an unordered map `bitmaskToIdx` to store the first occurrence of each bitmask.
- Initialize the map with the bitmask `0` at index `-1` to account for substrings starting from the beginning of the string.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**, for storing the bitmask and O(1) for the map since there are only a fixed number of possible vowel bitmask combinations (2^5 = 32).
