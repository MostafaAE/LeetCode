### Approach:
- Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the smallest ugly numbers.
- Start by pushing `1` into the heap as the first ugly number.
- Use a set to ensure only unique ugly numbers are processed.
- Extract the smallest element from the heap and generate new ugly numbers by multiplying it by 2, 3, and 5.
- Continue this process until we have generated `n` unique ugly numbers.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n logn)`**, where `n` is the input number. Each insertion and extraction in the heap is O(log n).
- **Space Complexity: `O(n)`**,  due to the heap and set storing up to `n` elements.
