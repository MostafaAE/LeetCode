     * Approach:
     * Greedy + Priority Queue (Max-Heap)
     * 
     * For each index `i`, we want to ensure at least `nums[i]` active removals are ongoing at that index.
     * - We use a max-heap to always prioritize the farthest available end index from current index.
     * - We maintain an `end[]` array to track when each removal ends (delayed prefix sum).
     * - If at some index `i`, we need more active removals than currently available, we pull more from the heap.
     *   If we cannot (heap empty or only offers expired ranges), we return -1.
     * 
     * Time Complexity: 
     * - O(N + Q * log Q + Q * log Q) â‰ˆ O(N + Q log Q)
     *   where N = size of nums, Q = number of queries.
     *   Sorting queries takes O(Q log Q), and heap operations take log Q.
     * 
     * Space Complexity: O(Q + N)
     * - Heap, end[] array, and other temporary variables.
