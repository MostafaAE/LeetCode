/*
 * Approach:
 * We want to find the length of the longest harmonious subsequence.
 * A harmonious subsequence is one where the difference between the maximum and minimum value is exactly 1.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Count the frequency of each number using an unordered_map.
 * 2. For each number in the map, check if either (num - 1) or (num + 1) exists.
 *    - If so, the potential subsequence length is freq[num] + freq[num Â± 1].
 * 3. Keep track of the maximum length encountered.
 *
 * Time Complexity  : O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
 *                    One pass to build the frequency map, and one pass to check neighboring elements.
 * Space Complexity : O(n), for the unordered_map storing frequencies.
