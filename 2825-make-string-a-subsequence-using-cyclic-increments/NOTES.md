### Approach:
1. Use two pointers, `itr1` for `str1` and `itr2` for `str2`, initialized to 0.
2. Traverse `str1`:
- Compare the current character of `str1` (`str1[itr1]`) with the current character of `str2` (`str2[itr2]`).
- If they are equal, or if shifting `str1[itr1]` by 1 (cyclically within the alphabet) matches `str2[itr2]`, increment `itr2` to move to the next character in `str2`.
- Always increment `itr1` to continue checking the next character in `str1`.
3. If `itr2` reaches the size of `str2`, return `true` (all characters of `str2` matched in sequence within `str1`).
4. If the loop ends without matching all of `str2`, return `false`.
