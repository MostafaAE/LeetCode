### Approach:
- The problem is to find the minimum number of days required to disconnect a grid of land cells.
- The strategy involves three main steps:
1- Count the number of islands initially present in the grid. If it is not exactly one, return 0.
2- Attempt to disconnect the grid by removing each land cell one at a time, and check if the grid becomes disconnected (i.e., the number of islands changes). If successful, return 1.
3- If no single removal results in disconnection, return 2 (since removing any two cells must disconnect the grid).

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O((n * m)^2)`**, where `n` and `m` are the number of rows and columns, respectively. The DFS traversal is repeated for each land cell.
- **Space Complexity: `O(n * m)`**
