/*
 * Approach:
 * To maximize performance, we want to select at most `k` engineers such that:
 * Performance = sum_of_speeds * min_efficiency.
 *
 * Strategy:
 * - Sort engineers by efficiency in descending order.
 * - Iterate through engineers, and at each step:
 *     - Consider current engineer's efficiency as the minimum for the team.
 *     - Maintain a min-heap to keep the top `k` speeds (remove smallest if heap exceeds size k).
 *     - Calculate performance using current sum of speeds and current efficiency.
 *     - Update result accordingly.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 * - Sorting: O(n log n)
 * - Each insertion/removal in the heap: O(log k) over `n` iterations â†’ O(n log k)
 * - Total: O(n log n)
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
 * - For the heap and auxiliary vectors
