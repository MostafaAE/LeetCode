    * Approach:
    * - Use the two-pointer technique to efficiently find if there are two numbers whose squares sum to c.
    * - Initialize two pointers: left at 0 and right at sqrt(c).
    * - Iterate with the while loop:
    *   - Calculate the sum of the squares of the values pointed by left and right.
    *   - If the sum equals c, return true.
    *   - If the sum is less than c, increment the left pointer to increase the sum.
    *   - If the sum is greater than c, decrement the right pointer to decrease the sum.
    * - If no pair is found by the time left exceeds right, return false.
    *
    * Complexity:
    * - Time Complexity: O(âˆšc)
    * - Space Complexity: O(1)
