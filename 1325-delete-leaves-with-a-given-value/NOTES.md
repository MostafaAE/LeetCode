### Approach:
- Use a post-order traversal (left, right, root) to process leaf nodes first.
- Recursively remove leaf nodes with the target value from the left and right subtrees.
- If the current node becomes a leaf node and its value equals the target, return nullptr to remove it.
- Otherwise, return the current node.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- **Space Complexity: `O(h)`**, where h is the height of the binary tree (auxiliary space for stack `h` could be `(n)` or `(logn)` depending on the shape of the tree).
