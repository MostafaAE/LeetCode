### Approach:
Iterate through the string in reverse. Upon encountering the first non-space character, identify it as the end of the last word. Continue iterating until a space character or the string's beginning is reached.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity: `O(n)`**
- **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**
